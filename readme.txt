[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod just makes it a little easier to install mods that were written exclusively for earlier versions of SMF!!!  How?  Well, continue reading!

This mod determines what version of Simple Machines Forum software (SMF) is needed to be emulated in order to install the mod and alters the install/upgrade/uninstall link so that the necessary forum version is included automatically, making mod installation a bit easier.  It also displays what version is going to be emulated in the install/upgrade/uninstall link.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Inspiration[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This feature was backported from the SMF 2.1 Beta 2 software, which has similar functionality built in.  However, no code from SMF 2.1 Beta 2 was used in the making of this mod.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Compatibility Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.11, but should work on SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.  

Furthermore, SMF 2.1 will not be supported, as it already has this functionality built in.
